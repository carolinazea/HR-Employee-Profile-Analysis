# HR-Employee-Profile-Analysis
Fictional dataset retrieved uncovers the external/internal factors that lead to employee attrition. 

Hypothesis: both genders receive the same amount of perfomance ratings, workers from various educational backgrounds have been at the same company for many years, and the higher the age of a worker, the more daily rate they recieve. 

I uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.


Findings: 

• Incoming workers are choosing to enter the sales field as that department pays relatively more than any other department.

• We can infer potential candidates may be required to have a Bachelors Degree (depending on the department and job responsibilites).

• Go into Research & Development for better work life balance practices.

• An employee that has stayed at one company for 10 years compared to 1 years, can make the same exact hourly rate.

• Marital Status has no influence on business travel options.
